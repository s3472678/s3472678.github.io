      <h1 class="text-body-emphasis" id="interest-in-it">Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>My interest in IT and computers in general started when I was young. I still remember the day we set up our first computer in the house, it had a turbo button on the front and you had to wait for it to be ready to be shut down instead of shutting itself down. I was fortunate enough to have a computer in my bedroom without internet, and spent a lot of my time trying to break it and fix it again, understanding how different things worked, and seeing what I could do with the command line. I spent a lot of my teenage years teaching myself programming and started building websites.</p>
      <p>I have been fortunate enough to have a career in IT for over 10 years, starting in a desktop support role. Despite not having formal education in IT, I was able to move out of desktop support and into consulting where I was exposed to a number of new environments and challenges. During this period I also picked up programming again with the goal to move into a software development role which I have since met and am now leading a team of software developers in an EdTech company.</p>
      <p>Studying with RMIT was an attractive choice to me because of the flexible approach to course delivery. I wanted to continue working full time, and studying with RMIT has allowed me to do this. As I completed my courses out of order, this is one of my final courses despite typically being delivered in the first year.</p>
      <p>During my studies I have gained a broad understanding of IT, from business impact to networking and software development. Through this course I hope to expand understanding of the impact of IT and innovation to our industries and economy.</p>

      <h1 class="text-body-emphasis" id="ideal-job">Ideal Job</h1>
      <p>Title: Principal Software Engineer</p>
      <p>Company: Snowflake</p>
      <p>Posting: <a href="https://careers.snowflake.com/us/en/job/5707762002/Principal-Software-Engineer-Native-Application-Framework" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
      <p>Snowflake is a data-as-a-service technology company providing data storage and analytics tooling. The Principal Software Engineer role is advertised for the Native Application Framework team, who are responsible for building the Native Application Framework product which provides developers with a platform and tooling to develop and host data-intensive applications.</p>
      <p>A Principal Software Engineer role is typically the most senior individual contributor role in a team or division of a company. This role in particular has the opportunity for a high level of impact, leading company wide initiatives for the Native Application Framework. This role is particularly interesting to me because the technical expertise required for this role is very high with deep foundational knowledge required in specific technologies. This is the level that I aspire to reach one day.</p>
      <p>This role requires the applicant to at least have a Bachelor of Computer Science or related major, and at least 15 years of experience, not only as a software developer but as a software developer working on complex distributed systems at scale. Strong knowledge of computer science fundamentals and fluency with the Java programming language are also required. While the role is not advertised as a people manager role, there are still expectations of technical leadership, so experience leading projects and products is also required.</p>
      <p>I currently possess some of the required skills as I have worked with distributed systems in the past and presently, particularly using message based and event driven architectures. I also have some experience working with the Java programming language, and have some exposure to the inner workings of databases. However, I do not have the years of experience required, nor the depth of knowledge required to be a suitable candidate for this role. Additionally, while I have experience leading a team as a people manager, I do not have experience leading company wide initiatives or projects.      </p>
      <p>In order to make myself a suitable candidate for a role such as the Principal Engineer role at Snowflake, I need to dedicate my working years to developing a T shaped skill set where I am able to develop specialised knowledge in one domain or technology, and continue to develop a broader level of understanding of other domains and technologies.I’m particularly interested in large scale distributed systems, so I intend to continue developing my experience and competency in this area. Additionally, I would need to gain experience leading large, impactful projects that span not only divisions of a company but company wide also. While it’s not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, I believe the opportunities to develop such niche and specialised experience may only be available at companies that are faced with unique challenges at scale, so experience at a fast growing company is also likely required.</p>

      <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Test Results</h3>
      <p>16Personalities.com - Myers-Briggs Test: INTJ-T</p>
      <p>How-to-study.com - Learning style test: Visual</p>
      <p>Idealist.org - What’s your work style?: Organised, sequential, planned, detail oriented. </p>
      <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Reflection</h3>
      <p>I found the results of the Myers-Briggs particularly interesting even though I approached it with scepticism. I was surprised to learn that it was one of the least common personality types, and identified with many of the strengths and weaknesses of the type. </p>
      <p>For the learning style test, I chose to do a test from how-to-study.com, the result I received was that I was a visual learner - which I tend to agree with however I feel I have had more success with hands-on or practical learning methods. </p>
      <p>For the third test, I chose a work style test from Idealist.org particularly because of its relevance for the assessment. The result I received was “Organised, sequential, planned, detail oriented”. Reflecting on how I plan projects and lead my team in my professional life I can see shared attributes. </p>
      <p>I believe the Myers-Briggs and the Work Style test are the most beneficial when working in a team, not just for my own understanding of how I might interact in a team environment, but also how I can best understand other team members' styles of working and their personalities. </p>
      <p>When forming a team I would not place much value in the results of these tests, unless there was something that was particularly alarming or opposite to how I try to work. For example, I may prefer a team member who tends to show more planning and organisation in their work style, as opposed to a team member who does not plan their work effectively or often starts their work closer to a deadline. </p>

      <h1 class="text-body-emphasis" id="project-idea">Project Idea</h1>
      <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Overview</h3>
      <p>Invaice.io is an all in one, project management, CRM and invoicing and payments product focused on the digital services market, aimed at freelance and self-employed businesses. The Invaice.io product provides its customers with a way to not only invoice their customers for work and services delivered, but also follow up with customers and request payments that have passed their due date through AI enhanced features that can communicate with customers on the users behalf. Invaice.io aims to automate all the boring parts of owning a small business - empowering users to focus on delivering and growing their business. </p>
      <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Motivation</h3>
      <p>The percentage of freelancers and gig-economy workers that make up the workforce has increased since 2014, with freelancing potentially becoming the majority of how people are employed in the workforce (Upwork, 2017). While software providing support for invoicing and payments is not a new concept, the software vendors of these products often target large to enterprise level companies for their deals, as the features they require are usually complex and are able to charge higher subscription fees (MYOB, 2023). Where larger vendors focus on enterprise level features, Invaice.io intends to focus solely on servicing the freelance and self-employed sector, by creating tools that fit their unique use cases.</p>
      <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Description</h3>
      <p>Invaice.io aims to be a one-stop-shop for freelancers and small business owners, with a mission of empowering them to focus on the things they do best, not spending time chasing invoices. Invaice.io does this through comprehensive features that provide users with their own CRM, Project Management Tool and Payments facilitation. </p>
        <h4 class="text-body-emphasis">Customers</h4>
        <p>Users are able to create and import lists of their Customers into the product, providing them with their own Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool. Users will be able to see a holistic view of each of their Customers, how much they have spent, previous projects and communications between the two parties.</p>
        <h4 class="text-body-emphasis">Projects</h4>
        <p>As freelancers tend to work on multiple projects (Fountain, 2022) providing a way for users to plan, track and schedule projects is essential. Invaice.io provides a project management feature set including kanban boards and project schedulers  that enables freelancers to project manage their work, charge for their work and be paid for their work in one tool.</p>
        <h4 class="text-body-emphasis">Invoices</h4>
        <p>Using Invaice.io’s invoice template builder, users are able to build their own invoice template or select from pre-made designs. Additionally, users are able to customise what their customers see on their invoices, with the ability to link line items back to items on their project board, or links to completed work artefacts. Finally, users are able to send their invoices to customers through multiple channels, including email, online chat, or sms.</p>
        <h4 class="text-body-emphasis">Payments</h4>
        <p>Getting paid is potentially the most important part of a freelancers business. Invaice.io allows users to accept payments from credit cards and bank transfers without having to enter into an agreement with a bank by partnering with payments infrastructure providers such as Stripe (Stripe, 2023). Providing users with a way to accept payments inside Invaice.io instead of simply providing their banking details on the invoice itself provides a more seamless experience for their customers, with customers able to make payment online - directly through their invoice link which we believe will help users to have their invoices paid on time.</p>
        <h4 class="text-body-emphasis">Enhanced Communications</h4>
        <p>In addition to the above features that focus on empowering the freelance and self-employed experience with an all in one product for their project management, invoicing and payments - Invaice.io also provides its users with the ability to auto generate communications with their customers. Powered by a large-language model (LLM), Invaice.io users will be able to select pre-generated text to add to correspondence with their customers, whether it be asking customers to review a design, pay an invoice or follow up on a past-due invoice - users will be able to spend less time communicating back and forth with their customers and more time on their business.</p>
    <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Tools and Techniques</h3>
    <p>In order to support this project, the only hardware required will be a computer with an internet connection. Software required will include common software development tools such as a code editor such as VsCode (VisualStudio, 2023).</p>
    <p>There will be multiple software components required to build this project. First of all, the project will require a website for marketing purposes, so that potential users can find and learn more about the product and features that Invaice.io offers. In addition the marketing site, Invaice.io will require the product itself to be written.</p>
    <p>There are multiple methodologies and technologies that can be used to build a web application product, at the very least Invaice.io will require both a front-end project and a back-end project.</p>
    <p>The front end will house all of the logic and user interfaces where the user will primarily be interacting with the product. There are multiple front-end software frameworks available that provide developers with a rapid way to build their product (Monocubed, 2021).</p>
    <p>The back-end project will house all of the business logic to power the features that users will interact with through the front-end, additionally the back-end project will house all integrations to 3rd party services that Invaice.io will leverage in order to provide the functionality required. Integrations such as Stripe for processing payments, and OpenAI for enhanced communications. Utilising 3rd party services allows Invaice.io to leverage the expertise and knowledge from other companies in its own service offering. Much like the front-end, the back-end also will leverage existing frameworks to accelerate development (Back4App, 2023).</p>
    <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Skills Required</h3>
    <p>UI design and software development skills are required to build this project. UI designers will need to be able to design seamless experiences that align with the branding and values of the Invaice.io project with its focus on simplifying the freelancer experience.</p>
    <p>Software developers will be required to have an understanding of both front and back end technologies, so “Full Stack Developers” (Freecodecamp, 2021) that can write software on both UI and backend business logic are required.</p>
    <p>There are currently around 2 million IT professionals in Australia (Herohunt.ai, 2023), and the roles, skills and technologies listed above are common across active listings for both Full Stack developers and UI Designers (Seek, 2023).</p>
    <h3 class="text-body-emphasis">Outcome</h3>
    <p>Once completed and released to the market, Invaice.io will have a tangible impact on the day to day lives of self-employed and freelancers - by providing them with an all in one toolset, designed to simplify the running of their business. With Invaice.io available, this should influence more people to turn to freelancing, enriching their professional lives as they have the freedom to be their own boss, choose when and what they work on (Upwork, 2017).</p>
